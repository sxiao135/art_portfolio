Define Requirements:
Identify the features you want in your portfolio. This might include an image gallery, project descriptions, a contact form, etc.
Decide on the overall layout and design.
- photos of projects and sketches
- projects with descriptions
- 1 front page
- 1 page for studies
- 1 page for physical projects
- 1 page for digital projects
- 1 page for phi rho flyers; this can be a carousel
- contact information

Choose a Tech Stack:
Since you're familiar with Java, SQL, and Python, you might consider using a web framework like Flask (Python), Spring Boot (Java), or Django (Python).
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be essential for the frontend. You might want to use a frontend framework or library like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- Django

Set Up Your Project:
Choose a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to your code.
Set up a database to store information about your projects. You can use SQL for this (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- sql for data storage LOL

Create a Database Schema:
Define tables to store information about your art projects. This might include fields such as project name, description, images, and any other relevant information.

Backend Development:
Use your chosen backend framework to create routes or controllers that handle requests related to your portfolio.
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your projects.

Frontend Development:
Design the user interface using HTML and CSS. You can use a template or create your own design.
Use JavaScript (or a frontend framework) to make your portfolio interactive. Consider features like image sliders, modal popups for project details, etc.

Integrate Backend and Frontend:
Connect your frontend and backend to ensure they communicate effectively. This might involve making API calls from the frontend to fetch data from the backend.

Image Upload and Handling:
Implement a feature to upload and manage images for each project.
Consider using a cloud storage service (like AWS S3 or Firebase Storage) to store your images.

Security:
Implement user authentication if you want to allow users to log in. This is optional but can be useful for features like a personalized dashboard.

Testing:
Test your application to ensure it works as expected. Check for bugs and fix any issues.

Deployment:
Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and deploy your portfolio.

Domain and SEO (Optional):
Consider purchasing a domain for your portfolio for a more professional look.
Implement basic SEO practices to make your portfolio discoverable.
